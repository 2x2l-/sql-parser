/**
        This node represents a like comparison operator (no escape)

        If the like pattern is a constant or a parameter then if possible
        the like is modified to include a >= and < operator. In some cases
        the like can be eliminated.  By adding =, >= or < operators it may
        allow indexes to be used to greatly narrow the search range of the
        query, and allow optimizer to estimate number of rows to affected.


        constant or parameter LIKE pattern with prefix followed by optional wild 
        card e.g. Derby%

        CHAR(n), VARCHAR(n) where n < 255

                >=   prefix padded with '\u0000' to length n -- e.g. Derby\u0000\u0000
                <=   prefix appended with '\uffff' -- e.g. Derby\uffff

                [ can eliminate LIKE if constant. ]


        CHAR(n), VARCHAR(n), LONG VARCHAR where n >= 255

                >= prefix backed up one characer
                <= prefix appended with '\uffff'

                no elimination of like


        parameter like pattern starts with wild card e.g. %Derby

        CHAR(n), VARCHAR(n) where n <= 256

                >= '\u0000' padded with '\u0000' to length n
                <= '\uffff'

                no elimination of like

        CHAR(n), VARCHAR(n), LONG VARCHAR where n > 256

                >= NULL

                <= '\uffff'


        Note that the Unicode value '\uffff' is defined as not a character value
        and can be used by a program for any purpose. We use it to set an upper
        bound on a character range with a less than predicate. We only need a single
        '\uffff' appended because the string 'Derby\uffff\uffff' is not a valid
        String because '\uffff' is not a valid character.
